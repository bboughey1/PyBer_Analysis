# PyBer_Analysis

This assignment was done for the Module 5 challenge to analyze fare attributes for PyBer.  Fare data were analyzed to determine total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver.  Then for the period of Jan 1 - Apr 28, 2018 the fares by city type were plotted.  Urban cities have the most rides and drivers and take in the most total fares, but have lower average fares per ride and driver.  Rural cities have the least rides and drivers but the highest average fare per driver and ride, likely because distances are greater between destinations in rural areas.

Difficulties were encountered in formatting the final summary table in the part 1 challenge.  Despite exactly mirroring Drew's code, I couldn't get the table to display properly, ostensibly due to some issue with map().  I don't know how to fix it.

Additional analysis might be to look at fares and rides by days of the week, and determine their descriptive information and plot comparisions of days of the week for the three types of cities.  This would be done by using resample and then examining the results in the fashion previously performed.
